# Codex-Environments

This very small repo has one purpose: a good set up script for use in OpenAI Codex Environments.

This repo was created 25 June 25 when .net was not natively supported, nor docker.

I'm a software engineer and OpenAI's Codex is the first real low-cost (i.e. with flat monthly fee) high-value way we have of iterating until a solution is correctly (at least built) and maybe unit tested (if you have such things).

I usually make stuff like this private, so if this was useful to you, then give this repo a star ‚≠ê thanks! -- Simon C.
